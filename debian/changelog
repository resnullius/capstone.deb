capstone (2.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release (closes: #741028).
    - Build only the Python bindings for now.
  * debian/patches:
    - typos: Added to fix some stuff I spotted.
    - no_usr_lib64: Remove the distinction that makes x86_64 install the
      library in /usr/lib64.
    - use_cppflags: Add the usage of CPPFLAGS to the build in order to have
      proper hardened build.
    - fix_python_bindings: Add necessary includes and library directories to
      build the bindings in the same run as the library itself, together with
      a way to pass arbitrary arguments to setup.py.
